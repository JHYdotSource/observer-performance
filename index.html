            <p class="text__lorem">Performance [pə'fɔ:məns] in computing refers to the speed, efficiency, and responsiveness of 
                a computer system or application. It encompasses how quickly tasks are executed, resources are utilized, and 
                data is processed. Achieving optimal performance involves balancing factors like processing power, memory usage, 
                and input/output operations. High-performance systems deliver swift responses and handle resource-intensive 
                tasks effectively, enhancing user experience. Engineers employ various techniques, including code optimization, 
                caching, and parallel processing, to improve performance. As technology advances, measuring, monitoring, and 
                enhancing performance remain critical for ensuring seamless and efficient computing across a wide range of 
                applications and devices.</p>
